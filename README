The purpose of this project is to emulate the awesomeness of the Ruby Koans, and apply it 
to the Java language.

Why Java? 
Why not? 

We've all seen plenty of bad Java code, and written it ourselves. Hopefully these koans can
help people eager to learn Java; to write clean, maintainable code.

Current packaging is intended to be imported into an eclipse workspace, though the code
artifacts can stand on their own, or work in other IDEs. 

There are currently two branches on github - both of which will likely contain the same koans:
master: A no frills text based interface, with the intention of retaining a low barrier
	of entry, and few dependencies. Depends on JUnit and EasyMock(EasyMock is only necessary 
	for tests) No network access is necessary once obtaining the source from github, but 
	getting started is a tad rougher than the alternative...

/* 
 *	RUNNING - INSTRUCTIONS
 */
1. 	Download and setup Java (5+ required) SDK/JDK - JRE is not enough!
2. 	Compile classes in src/* (optionally, compile tests as well)
3. 	Start KoanSuiteRunner w/ no arguments to run all koans, in order from least difficult
	to most difficult.
	3a.	KoanSuiteRunner may be invoked with a simple/fully qualified koansuite class (
		located in com.sandwich.koan.suite.*) name to run just one Suite.
	3b.	For running just a specific @Koan, run with two arguments, simple/fully qualified
		koan suite name, the name of the koan method.
4.	Observe the console output from running the koans, fix, and rerun.

/*
 *	DEVELOPING - KOANS
 */
1.	Setup project in your IDE.
2.	Follow example from another KoanSuite class (located in com.sandwich.koan.suite.*)
3.	Place new koan suite (if applicable) in PathToEnlightment.createKoansList() - order
	IS important!
4.	Remember to place the __ on the right side so expectation string in console output
	makes sense to users.
5.	In the @Koan annotation, adjust the description accordingly.
6.	Run all tests to ensure that
	6a.	All Koans are failing (pupil learns by fixing)
	6b.	Expectations are passed properly (look in console output from test run)
7.	Commit the koans to a branch/fork of the java-koans project on github.

This project depends on: JUnit, TestNG, EasyMock, Gradle which are licensed separately and subject
