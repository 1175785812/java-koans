The purpose of this project is to emulate the awesomeness of the Ruby Koans, and apply it 
to the Java language.

Why Java? 
Why not? 

We've all seen plenty of bad Java code, and written it ourselves. Hopefully these koans can
help people eager to learn Java; to write clean, maintainable code.

Current packaging is intended to be imported into an eclipse workspace, though the code
artifacts can stand on their own, or work in other IDEs. 

A no frills text based interface, with the intention of retaining a low barrier
of entry, and few dependencies. Depends on JUnit and EasyMock(EasyMock is only necessary 
for tests).

/* 
 *	RUNNING - INSTRUCTIONS
 */
1. 	Download and setup Java (5+ required) SDK/JDK - JRE is not enough!
2. 	Compile classes in src/* (optionally, compile tests as well)
3. 	Start KoanSuiteRunner w/ no arguments to run all koans, in order from least difficult
	to most difficult.
	3a.	KoanSuiteRunner may be invoked with a fully qualified koansuite class (
		located in koan folder) name to run just one Suite.
	3b.	For running just a specific @Koan, run with two arguments, fully qualified
		koan suite name, the name of the koan method, separated by a space.
4.	Observe the console output from running the koans, fix, and rerun. Rinse and repeat.

/*
 *	DEVELOPING - KOANS
 */
1.	Setup project in your IDE.
2.	Follow example from another KoanSuite class (located in com.sandwich.koan.suite.*)
3.	Place new koan suite (if applicable) in PathToEnlightment.xml - order
	IS important - koans will not run if you miss a method, or suite!
4.	Remember to place the __ on the right side so expectation string in console output
	makes sense to users.
5.	In the @Koan annotation, adjust the description accordingly.
6.	Run all tests to ensure that
	6a.	All Koans are failing (pupil learns by fixing)
	6b.	Expectations are passed properly (look in console output from test run)
7.	Once the tests that check the integrity of the koans pass; commit the koans to a 
	branch/fork of the java-koans project on github.

This project has test that depend on: JUnit and EasyMock which are licensed separately and subject
to the terms and conditions applicable for each library.
