The purpose of this project is to emulate the awesomeness of the Ruby Koans, and apply it 
to the Java language.

Why Java? 
Why not? 

We've all seen plenty of bad Java code, and written it ourselves. Hopefully these koans can
help people eager to learn Java; to write clean, maintainable code.

Running Instructions:
1. Download and unarchive the contents of the most recent java-koans in development from:
   https://github.com/matyb/java-koans/archives/master
2. Open a terminal and cd to the directory you unarchived that file to's koans/src directory
3. run run.bat or run.sh (whichever is applicable for your OS)
4. follow the instructions on screen, and rerun the run file in the last step

Developing a Koan:
1. Follow any of the existing koans as an example to create a new class w/ koan methods (indicated by the @Koan annotation)
2. Define the order and metadata associated with each koan in the PathToEnlightment.xml
3. If necessary - use dynamic content in your lesson, examples are located in XmlVariableInjector class (and Test)
